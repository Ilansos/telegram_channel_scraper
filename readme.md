# Telegram Channel Scraper Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to set up and use the Telegram scraper script which collects data from Telegram channels.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.6 or higher
    MongoDB server

## Installation Steps
### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/Ilansos/telegram_channel_scraper.git
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up MongoDB

Ensure that MongoDB is installed and running on your system. By default, the scraper connects to MongoDB at mongodb://localhost:27017/. If your MongoDB setup differs, adjust the connection string that is located on the config.json file on the root directory of the project.

### 4. Obtain Telegram API ID and Hash

To use the Telegram API, you need an API ID and hash. Follow these steps to obtain them:

    Log in to Telegram:
    Go to the Telegram API Development Tools website.

    Register your application:
    Once logged in, select 'API development tools' and fill out the form to register your new application. You will need to provide the application name, a short description, and the application platform.

    Get your API ID and hash:
    After submitting the form, you will receive your api_id and api_hash. Note these down as you will need to enter them in your config.json file.

### 5. Configure the Scraper

Modify the config.json file that is located in the root directory the project with the following configuration parameters:

```
{
  "telegram_api_id": "YOUR_API_ID",
  "telegram_api_hash": "YOUR_API_HASH",
  "mongo_uri": "mongodb://localhost:27017/",
  "download_media": true,
  "channel_crawl_first": true
}
```
telegram_api_id: Your Telegram API ID.

telegram_api_hash: Your Telegram API hash.

mongo_uri: If your MongoDB setup differs, adjust the connection string as needed.

download_media: Set to true if you want to download media from messages.

channel_crawl_first: Set to true to only process the first message of each channel.

### 6. Install Translation Languages

Run the language_installer.py script to install the necessary languages for the translation library:

```
python language_installer.py
```

This script downloads and installs translation packages needed to convert content to English from various languages.

### 7. Running the Scraper

To run the Telegram scraper, use the following command:

```
python telegram_channel_scraper.py
```

Make sure that all configuration files such as keywords.txt, channel_list.txt, and config.json are correctly set up and present in the directory from which you run the script.
Usage Details

The script telegram_scraper.py reads the channel usernames and keywords from channel_list.txt and keywords.txt, respectively. Ensure that these files are formatted as one entry per line.

## Logging System

The scraper uses Python's logging module to log various events such as errors, warnings, and informational messages throughout its execution. Hereâ€™s how the logging is set up:

    Configuration: Logging is configured to output messages to both the console and a file named telegram_scraper.log.
    Levels: The logging level is set to DEBUG, which means all levels of logs (debug, info, warning, error, critical) will be captured.
    Format: Each log message contains the timestamp, logger name, level of severity, and the message content.
    File Logging: Logs are appended to the file, allowing for persistent storage of log data across multiple runs of the scraper.

To view the logs, you can open the telegram_scraper.log file in any text editor or tail it in a console window:

```
tail -f telegram_scraper.log
```

This can be especially helpful for debugging issues or monitoring the scraper's progress.
